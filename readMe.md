This was a project I did for class. I decided to post this one because I demonstrate my ability to navigate and manipulate many data files from the web. 

You can run this program on my repl.it:  " https://repl.it/@egutie39/Datahandeling "


URL for COVID cases data 
https://pomber.github.io/covid19/timeseries.json

URL for country names to codes
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pomber/covid19/master/docs/countries.json
